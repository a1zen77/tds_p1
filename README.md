I scraped GitHub user data for users in Hyderabad with over 50 followers using the GitHub API and my access token, using python's 'requests' library along with a query for required location and minimum follower count, and saved the data into seperate CSV files with structured columns for further analysis with pandas and excel.

An interesting fact I came upon was the fact that users in hyderabad have been active right from the time Github was publically released, in 2008. A funny fact is that the users are scraped from both Hyderabads the one in India and the one in our very friendly neighbouring country. This might be a unique case as I dont think any other popular city names repeat.

I would encourage developers to create more repositories containing projects of today's popular languages such as Go, Rust, Typescript, .net and highlight these skills in their bio as well. Moreover, focusing on the content of your projects rather than the number of repositories is always helpful.
